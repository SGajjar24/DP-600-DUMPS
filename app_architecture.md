# DP-600 Exam Preparation App Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for the DP-600 Exam Preparation Application. The application will provide a comprehensive test preparation environment for the Microsoft Fabric DP-600 certification exam with multiple test length options and PDF export functionality.

## Application Requirements
- Present questions in a test format with 15, 30, or 45 questions
- Allow users to select answers and track progress
- Provide immediate feedback on answers (optional)
- Calculate and display test results
- Generate PDF reports with test results and solutions
- Support both local deployment and cloud deployment (Vercel/Render)
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF and html2canvas
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Local (Node.js) and Vercel/Render

### Key Components

#### Pages
1. **Home Page**: Landing page with app introduction and test options
2. **Test Configuration Page**: Select test length and other options
3. **Test Page**: Display questions and collect answers
4. **Results Page**: Show test results and provide PDF export option

#### Components
1. **Header**: Application header with navigation
2. **Footer**: Application footer with links
3. **QuestionCard**: Display individual questions and answer options
4. **ProgressBar**: Show test progress
5. **Timer**: Optional timer for test duration
6. **ResultsSummary**: Summary of test results
7. **PDFExport**: Component for generating and downloading PDF reports

#### Services
1. **TestService**: Manage test state, questions, and answers
2. **PDFService**: Generate PDF reports with test results and solutions
3. **StorageService**: Handle local storage for saving test progress

## Data Flow

1. **Application Initialization**:
   - Load question data from JSON files
   - Initialize application state

2. **Test Configuration**:
   - User selects test length (15, 30, or 45 questions)
   - Application loads appropriate question set

3. **Test Execution**:
   - Questions are presented one at a time or in a scrollable list
   - User selects answers
   - Progress is tracked and saved

4. **Test Completion**:
   - User submits test or time expires
   - Application calculates results
   - Results are displayed with correct/incorrect answers

5. **PDF Generation**:
   - User requests PDF report
   - Application generates PDF with test results and solutions
   - PDF is offered for download

## Responsive Design Considerations
- Fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly UI elements for mobile devices
- Optimized rendering for different devices
- Appropriate font sizes and spacing for readability

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Deployment
- Node.js server to serve the static files
- Simple setup with minimal configuration

### Cloud Deployment
- **Vercel**: Direct deployment from GitHub repository
- **Render**: Static site hosting with automatic builds

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of components and data
- Optimized assets for faster loading
- Efficient state management to minimize re-renders
- Caching strategies for question data

## Accessibility Considerations
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management for interactive elements
